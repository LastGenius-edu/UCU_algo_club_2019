# Lecture 1: C++ introduction, implementation tasks

## IDE
Preferred IDE: **[CLION](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)**

Other choices: **[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, **[codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)**, **[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)**

### Installation

#### Preprequisites (Windows)
Before installation you should have C++ compiling and building tools installed on your system. One of the options is to install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) with the following packages: **gcc-g++**, **make**, **cmake**, **gdb**. See more info [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html)

#### Preprequisites (MAC, Linux)
You should have [cmake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your system

## C++ introduction

Materials are partially taken from [codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com/ioi/basics#) - Introductory Tutorials For Competitive Programming

### Materials

**NOTE**: These pdfs contains my notes and tips. I had some issues with displaying them. I recommend using **Adobe Acrobat Reader** under **Windows** and **Okular** under **Linux** and **MAC**.

* [Introduction to C++](Materials/Introduction_to_C++.pdf)
* [Data Types](Materials/DATATYPES+.pdf)
* [Control Flow](Materials/Control_Flow.pdf)
* [Input Output](Materials/IO.pdf)
* Functions

### Notions
* compiled vs interpreted programming language
* Object lifetime
* stack vs heap vs static memory
* const vs constexpr
